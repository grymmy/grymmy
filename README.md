Hey! I’m Graham!

As a teenager I fell in love with computers, starting with helping run some of the first online MUDs (they were kind of like early text-based MMO games).
The thing that has always most inspired me about computers is how you can use them to connect with other people, and as a paintbrush to create and edit the world around you.

After dropping out of college, I started working as a software engineer in Silicon Valley, where I helped make software used by millions of people. If you’ve ever received an AMBER alert on an old flip-phone from Verizon, or if you've ever opened the Uber app, then you've executed some of the code I've authored!

My mission is to help as many teenagers as possible fall in love with computers and coding like I did.  If you’re ever interested in contributing to Hack Club code or need help on some code you’re stuck on, please DM me on the Hack Club Slack (**@graham**) and I would love to help you get started!  My email is also graham@hackclub.com - please reach out!
